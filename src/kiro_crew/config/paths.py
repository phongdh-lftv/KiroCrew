"""Pure filesystem path primitives for KiroCrew configuration.

This is a **leaf module**: it depends only on the standard library
(``os``, ``sys``, ``pathlib``, ``logging``) and imports nothing from
``kiro_crew`` at import time. The one exception is a lazy, in-function import
of :mod:`kiro_crew.atomic_write` inside ``_write_recovery_breadcrumb`` (that
helper itself imports this module lazily, so there is no cycle). Modules that
only need to locate ``~/.kirocrew/`` should import
from here directly::

    from kiro_crew.config.paths import config_dir

so they don't transitively pull in the full config loader (DTOs, schema
validation, the process-global cache, and the lazily-imported provider
factory) the way ``from kiro_crew.config.loader import config_dir`` does.

Only the genuinely pure primitives live here. The *dir-derived* helpers
(``config_path``, ``config_local_path``, ``workspace_root``, ``workspace_dir_for``,
``outbox_dir``, ``env_path``, …) remain in :mod:`kiro_crew.config.loader` so that
their ``config_dir()`` lookups resolve in the loader namespace — preserving the
``patch("kiro_crew.config.loader.config_dir", ...)`` test seam used across the
suite.

All names here are also re-exported from ``kiro_crew.config.loader`` for
backward compatibility, so existing callers continue to work unchanged.

    3. Not yet resolved -> delegate to :func:`config_dir`, so the FIRST

       breadcrumb exactly once, per *start*.

    Deliberately NOT a cache of its own: case 1 must stay live, and case 2 reads

    its own grounds (see its docstring): a dangling launcher is caught by the

    temp resident that is a durable install in disguise: an AppImage's runtime
    mount, excluded at that call site via :func:`_in_ephemeral_tree`. This
    predicate stays a plain "is it under the temp root" answer so each caller
    keeps its own exemptions.

    ``/tmp`` -> ``/private/tmp``, ``/var/folders`` -> ``/private/var/folders``)
    and a symlink into the tree land in the same namespace.

    TWO roots are answered against, not one. ``tempfile.gettempdir()`` is the
    root as configured AT CALL TIME (it honours ``$TMPDIR``), matching how the
    rest of this module treats redirected environments — but on macOS launchd
    sets ``$TMPDIR`` to a per-user ``/var/folders/.../T``, so ``gettempdir()``
    alone does NOT contain ``/tmp``, and ``/tmp/<scratch clone>`` — the literal
    shape #4781 reports — would read as durable there. POSIX ``/tmp`` is
    therefore checked as well: it is reaped on reboot by contract, so nothing
    durable lives under it. ``/var/tmp`` deliberately is not: POSIX has it
    PRESERVED across reboots, which is the opposite claim.

    That literal is added on POSIX ONLY. ``Path("/tmp")`` is drive-RELATIVE on
    Windows, so ``.resolve()`` anchors it to the current drive and yields
    ``C:\\tmp`` — a path with none of the reboot-reaped meaning the rule rests on,

def kiro_home() -> Path:
    """Return the kiro home (``~/.kiro``), honoring a ``KIRO_HOME`` override.

    ``KIRO_HOME`` is kiro-cli's own documented override for its user-level
    directory. Honoring it here is what lets the agents directory — the specs that
    define which MCP servers exist — stop being unconditionally machine-wide, so a
    non-default instance can be told to own its own copy instead of rewriting the
    real install's (see ``agent._decline_shared_agent_home`` for what that
    rewriting costs: managed MCP servers that read one credential while calling a
    gateway that expects another, and 403 on every call).

    SCOPE — read before setting this. ``KIRO_HOME`` redirects kiro-cli's WHOLE
    user directory (agents, prompts, skills, steering, settings, sessions). The
    two subtrees Kiro Crew itself reads follow it through this resolver:
    the agents dir (:func:`kiro_agents_dir`) and the chat transcripts
    (:func:`kiro_sessions_dir`), so writer and reader stay in agreement and
    session resume survives the redirect. That is what lets an isolated instance
    own ``KIRO_HOME=<data home>/kiro`` -- ``build_pod_env`` sets it for a pod,
    the E2E harness for its test gateway, and :func:`adopt_isolated_kiro_home`
    for any other non-default data home. kiro-cli's login state lives
    outside ``~/.kiro`` and is unaffected.

    What does NOT follow it -- and therefore splits under a redirect, because
    kiro-cli reads ``<KIRO_HOME>/<subtree>`` while Kiro Crew keeps reading the
    HOST ``~/.kiro/<subtree>``:

    * ``settings/mcp.json``, the kiro-cli global MCP registry
      (``agent._KIRO_MCP_JSON``, ``apps/bridges.py``, ``mcp_discovery.py``,
      ``dashboard/handlers/mcp.py``). Inert for the servers kiro-cli actually
      connects: the specs Kiro Crew emits pin ``includeMcpJson`` off and carry
      the host registry merged in, so only a user editing the registry by hand
      and expecting kiro-cli's own reading of it to move would notice.
      ``pod/runtime.py`` records the same residual for ``kirocrew app`` in a pod.
    * ``skills`` (``agent.py`` skill-path discovery, ``dashboard/handlers/
      _shared.py``), ``hooks`` (``agent._DEFAULT_KIRO_HOOKS_DIR``), ``steering``
      (``dashboard/handlers/steering.py``) and ``prompts``
      (``dashboard/handlers/prompts.py``): the dashboard shows and edits the host
      copies while a redirected kiro-cli loads its own. For an install that
      relocated its data home permanently this is the visible cost of
      :func:`adopt_isolated_kiro_home`, and ``KIRO_HOME=~/.kiro`` is the opt-out;
      routing those readers through this resolver is the follow-up that removes
      it.

    changed. Idempotent; call it once from a process's synchronous prologue,
    before anything resolves :func:`kiro_home` or spawns kiro-cli.

    Why the PROCESS environment rather than a resolver-side rule in
    :func:`kiro_home`: the value has to reach kiro-cli, which reads ``KIRO_HOME``
    from its own environment and inherits ours (``acp/client.py`` spawns with
    ``{**os.environ}``), and every managed MCP shim under it inherits the same.
    One export in the prologue makes the gateway, its kiro-cli children, their
    ``kirocrew mcp-*`` stubs, and every ``kirocrew`` CLI verb run on this home
    agree on one kiro home -- exactly what ``build_pod_env`` already arranges for
    a pod by hand.

    Why at all: the agents directory is ``<kiro home>/agents``, and the default
    kiro home is the machine-wide ``~/.kiro`` -- NOT under ``KIROCREW_HOME``. A
    gateway booted with ``KIROCREW_HOME=<scratch>`` and no ``KIRO_HOME`` would
    otherwise rebuild the operator's shared ``~/.kiro/agents/*.json`` on boot and
    pin its own scratch home into every managed MCP server's ``env``
    (``agent._managed_mcp_env``). From then on every ``kirocrew-core`` stub the
    REAL gateway's sessions spawn resolves ``config_dir()`` to the scratch home,
    looks for its signed session-pid mapping there, finds nothing, and every
    strict-identity tool is refused with "signed pid mapping did not verify" --
    on a machine whose trust root is healthy. With its own kiro home the scratch
    instance writes ``<scratch>/kiro/agents`` instead, the write guard's
    private-target exemption admits that, and the shared specs stay the default
    instance's.

    What it deliberately does NOT do: touch a process that already carries a
    ``KIRO_HOME`` (an explicit choice: the operator decides which kiro home
    kiro-cli READS -- ``KIRO_HOME=~/.kiro`` keeps a relocated install on the
    machine-wide steering, skills and transcripts, at the cost that its managed
    MCP servers then follow the DEFAULT instance's specs, because a foreign data
    home never writes the shared ones), or a process on the default or legacy
    home. The declared value is NOT validated here: judging it means resolving
    it, and this is the boot path. :func:`kiro_home` applies its test where the
    value is read -- a ``KIRO_HOME`` naming ``/etc`` or an unresolvable path
    falls back to the shared ``~/.kiro`` there, with a warning, which lands the
    process exactly where the ``KIRO_HOME=~/.kiro`` opt-out does: reading the
    default instance's specs, never writing them (the write guard's ownership
    arm takes no environment variable as consent). And it is not a resolver:
    :func:`kiro_home` keeps reading the environment, so a test that isolates it
    with ``patch("pathlib.Path.home", ...)`` is unaffected.

    Scope note for an install that relocated its data home permanently: its
    kiro-cli children read agents, sessions, steering, skills and settings from
    ``<data home>/kiro`` rather than ``~/.kiro`` (kiro-cli's login state lives
    elsewhere and is unaffected). The adoption line names the opt-out above, and
    ``kirocrew doctor`` (Data Home) lists what the host ``~/.kiro`` still holds
    that such an instance does not read.

    Filesystem-free, deliberately: the only resolution it relies on is the one
    ``ensure_data_home()`` already paid for ``config_dir()``, and it neither stats
    nor resolves the adopted path, the declared ``KIRO_HOME``, or anything else.
    This runs before the gateway binds, and a probe on a roaming or UNC-backed
    home is a network round-trip that would hold readiness hostage. Whether the

    Honours :data:`_agents_dir_override` when one is installed, which is what
    makes this the single accessor every consumer already routes through. See
    :func:`ambient_agents_dir` for the one caller that must NOT follow it.

    The no-override branch DELEGATES to that function rather than re-spelling
    ``kiro_home() / "agents"``. Two hand-written copies of the default would let a
    later change to the layout land in only one, and the write guard compares this
    resolver's answer against that one -- a stale comparison there reads a shared
    target as private and fails OPEN on the machine-wide home, which is the #4912
    failure class this whole seam exists to prevent.
